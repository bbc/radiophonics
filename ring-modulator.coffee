# # Ring Modulator
#
# [Ring Modulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_modulation) was
# one of the most recognisable effects used by the Radiophonic
# Workshop. It was the effect used to create the voices of both the
# Cybermen and The Daleks for Dr Who.
#
# A simple way to achieve a Ring Modulation effect is to simply
# multiply the input signal by the carrier signal. This approach
# doesn't allow for the characteristic distortion sound that was
# present in early analogue ring modulators which used a "ring" of
# diodes to achieve the multiplication of the signals.
#
# ![Circuit diagram of a traditional ring modulator](/img/circuit_diagram_parker.png "Circuit diagram")
#
# To create a more realistic sound we use the digital model of an
# analogue ring-modulator proposed by Julian Parker. (Julian Parker.
# [A Simple Digital Model Of The Diode-Based
# Ring-Modulator](http://recherche.ircam.fr/pub/dafx11/Papers/66_e.pdf).
# Proc. 14th Int. Conf. Digital Audio Effects, Paris, France, 2011.)
#
# To create the voice of the Daleks the Workshop used a 30Hz sine wave
# as the modulating signal - this was recorded onto a tape loop and
# connected to one input. A microphone was connected to the second
# (carrier) input. The actor could then use the effect live on the set
# of Dr Who. In our demo we allow you to change the frequency (by
# modifying the playback speed of the tape machine). The tape machines
# used originally did not playback at a constant speed - this
# contributed to the distinctive sound of the early Daleks.
